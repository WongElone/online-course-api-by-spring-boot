# Online Course API (Spring Boot)
This is one of my showcase projects, which is about constructing API for an imaginary online course website. The core technology is Java Spring Boot.  

## âœ¨API is open for test nowâœ¨
ðŸ“„ Read the API endpoints documentation here: https://demo-online-course-api.elonewong.com/swagger-ui  
- It is interactive, you can test the endpoints directly on this docuhttps://demo-online-course-api.elonewong.com/swagger-ui/index.htmlmentation website. You can also test the endpoints with other tools, such as Postman.  
- Note that endpoints are protected by authentications, you should first request the authentication endpoints to aquire an JWT access token before visiting other endpoints.
